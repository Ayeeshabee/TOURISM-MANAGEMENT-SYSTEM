# TOURISM-MANAGEMENT-SYSTEM
Our DBMS project is based on Complete Online Tourism System 
Management. It provides various information about the various activities 
such as studying tour destination, Planning the tour, Making Travel 
arrangements and providing accommodation. 
As the name specifies “TOURISM MANAGEMENT SYSTEM” is a software developed 
for managing tour booking.
